# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems

In this session, you can find entirely implemented by me some contraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) using ic and       branch-and-bound ECLiPSe libraries. 

## Getting Started

You can download all solutions to the problems just by typing: 
```
git clone https://github.com/PanPapag/Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems.git
```

### Prerequisites

ECLiPSe environment for constraint programming is mandatory in order to test the solutions to the problems above. You can simply download ECLiPSe here:
```

```

## Problems description 

* [Partition Problem] : One version of the problem of partitioning numbers is as follows. Given a positive integer 𝑁, divide the set 𝑆 = {1, 2, 3, ..., 𝑁} into two subsets 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 (𝑆1 ∩ 𝑆2 = ∅, 𝑆1 ∪ 𝑆2 = 𝑆) such that S1 and S2 have the same number of elements (| 𝑆1 | = | 𝑆2 |), the sum of the elements of 𝑆1 equals the sum of the elements of 𝑆2 (Σ𝑖 ∈𝑆1 𝑖 = Σ𝑗∈𝑆2 𝑗) and the sum of the squares of the elements of 𝑆1 equals the sum of the squares of the elements of 𝑆2 (Σ𝑖 ∈𝑆1 𝑖2 = Σ𝑗∈𝑆2 𝑗2).
